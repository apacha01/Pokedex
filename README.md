# Pokedex
Pokedex made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the pokeapi v2.

# Demo
You can check it [here](https://apacha01.github.io/Pokedex/).

# Branches
 * `master` branch currently done without classes and in single file.
 * `classes` branch is the project divided into files with classes, using modules and documented (also includes a soundtrack). This is a way better version.

 # Expanding it
 I tried to be as similar to the original GEN I pokedex (from *Pokemon Red*) as possible, so any pokemon search that isn't a GEN I won't be found. That's a hardcoded limitation that you can easily remove, but in the original NES the **all** pokemon had a name with at most 10 characters (screen size reasons), and i made it like that. There's also the description that has the same max length for every pokemon and i did that in a kind of weird way (the first thing i came up with, check the html). So those changes should be made for a good looking pokedex.
